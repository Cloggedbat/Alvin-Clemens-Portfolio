So starting out on this project I have layed out daily goals. If the daily goal is meet and I feel the need to continue that will be the plan.

Day 1
7/26

    Goal of the day:
    I am looking to build the skeliton of the portfolio: 
                    
                    *Build out a rough outline of the homepage
                        *draw outline to have a viusal to work off of 
                    *Have the other pages linked to the home page with a working nave bar
                    *find pictures and videos that might be of use
                        during a break
                    *Pick up graph paper
                ** site wont go live on Git look into that


    Notes of the day: $$$=secsess ???=what just happened @@@=code del and save slot ***=added objective

        $$$-Navbar is up and running added the pages  <href="./Homepage/portfoliopage.html"> to each page, this shows the navbar the location to send the page.

        ???-So im gonna link all the pages to hompage style sheet this could be nice but will see in the future if it messes anything up.
            $$-all linked, will see if I reget this 
        
        @@@- deleted word box could be used if i change my mind div class="badge badge-primary text-wrap" style="width: 100rem;">

        $$$-Video added to contacts page, just for fun 
            $$-centered video
                ??- vieos is centeder but it looks as if i did it the wrong way center is in red
            ???- so the video is reponcive but I need to find a way to drop it down I will look into also adding text above the video 

Contacts page
        **-so the text above the video looks good i need to work on the margins around the video and look at haveing the text fit into some smaller coloums rather then taking up 12 slots
        $?$- so i dont know if this is the best way to do this but i put in (<br><br>) to put in the break between the video and the text.
